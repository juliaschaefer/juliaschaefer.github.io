title: TYPE DESIGN
description: In a class of the module „Type Design“ we started a Barock typeface called „Plenum“ where everyone had to do some letters and glyphs. For the elaboration of the whole typeface, spacing and lettering, Philipp Bührer and I did all of the correcting, adapting and then the finalising.
