title: REALITAT
subtitle: Ein irritatives Repertoire
description: The Publication „REALITAT – a disorientating repertoire“ was developed as part of our bachelor thesis in Spring 2015. It is a Laboratory Diary and compendium of our visual research. The abstract images work independently and do not require further visual references. They are records of procedures of chemistry, optics and reproduction processes. The images confuse with their creation and appearance, they visualize the incomprehensible and artificial of the virtual.<br/>We have only utilized everyday objects. The goal was to maximize the potential of the analogue image research. We turned our attention to the moment when irritation occurs. The viewer will be deceived by the deformation, alienation and abstraction. During our research we defined the thesis that attention can be created through irritation. Therefore it is an important aspect of visual communication.<br/>We classed the created images in eight categories and documented them in this publication. We complemented our description with insights and qualities of each chapter. The materials used are photographically documented at the end of every chapter and included in the index. The merging of photographies at the start and finish of the book references to public space and oddities of the everyday life.
