title: LONDON UNDERGROUND
description: Last year, the London Underground celebrated its 150th anniversary. The task was to design a poster in one day for a poster exhibition in the London Transport Museum. After a broad research I decided to use a static element representing the billboard and a more dynamic shapes expressing the tube lines. I have chosen the colours from the Central line (red) and the Waterloo / City line (turquoise). The final outcome was done in screenprinting to get a third colour by overlapping.
