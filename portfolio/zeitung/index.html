title: BLICK AM ABEND
description: This project was done in a letterpress course. I used a free evening newspaper „Blick am Abend“ as a base. Every evening the papers arrived at the distribution boxes and I took a few of them, printed a sentence on them, and later at night put them back in the boxes. This was intended as a critique of the content and the newspaper proposes to be food for thought.
