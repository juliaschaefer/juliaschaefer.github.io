title: ATLAS DER PLASTIKINSELN
description: In this project we had to create an atlas about catastrophes. We chose  plastic waste in the ocean as our topic. The restriction was to show information not just with graphics and diagrams but also with analog experiments. This project was a collaboration with Sibylle Frutiger and Joana Kelen.
