title: AROUND THE WORLD
description: „Everything“ was the topic of a workshop with Laurenz Brunner and Julia Born. For the publication we collected various circles. From east to west around the globe we took pictures of the sun and of roundabouts from Google Maps. The third and only text element are the w-lan names of all the districts of Zurich – through the web, everything comes together.
