title: SOUND:FRAME
description: We created the posters for the 10th anniversary of the festival for audiovisual art.  We developed the idea of an analogous intervention into the printing plateâ€™s layout. The preceding graphics are kept deliberately subtle and are fractured and altered by the analog intervention. Treated with a spray can, brick trowel, sponge, paintbrush, and broom, every poster grade sheet is given its own individual character. Manipulating the offset plate as a design element plays with the factor of coincidence; the results vary depending on the tools, printing format, hand movements, toner levels, etc. that were used.  <br/><br/>Art Direction:100und1
