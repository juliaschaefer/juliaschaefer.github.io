description: We were fascinated by the artificial environment of the Zoological Garden and were looking for an archive we could use. We were looking for images with just compounds on it, no animals. In the archive we found a collection of old slides we could use. The selection is arranged according to the date it was taken. This project was a collaboration with Sara Hardegger.
