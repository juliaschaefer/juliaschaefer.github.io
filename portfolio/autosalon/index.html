title: AUTOSALON
description: The Motorshow in Geneva takes place every year and our course allows to submit our ideas. One draft was a typographic design and the other concept was based on photography. The imagery on the posters show fragments of cars and the world around the Motorshow. On the typographic drafts we tried to visualize the sounds of moving cars. This was a collaboration with Robin Coenen.
