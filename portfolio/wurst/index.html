description: How do you exploit the appearance and the content of an animal? We were interested in the topic of the form/casing and the content. We asked three small companies if we could visit and take some pictures. The sausage skin (casing), sausage (meat stuffed sausage skin) and fur served us as a visual mechanism. We visited a sausage skin company, a butcher and a taxidermist. This project was a collaboration with Selina Theiler and Aurelia Zihlmann.
