title: JOSEPH BINDER AWARD
description: We created the campaign for the Austrian Design Award 2016. The major constraint was that the campaign design should be reminiscent of graphic designer Joseph Binder. We decided to take abstract forms out of some of Binders poster designs and create a contemporary and modern composition. The visual noise, an element often found in posters of the 1930ties, is taken to the extreme.  <br/><br/>Art Direction:100und1
